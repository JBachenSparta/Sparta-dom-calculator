## Task

* add events to calculator for number buttons
* add events to calculator for operation buttons
* return selections to GUI
* find result of user inputs, and return that answer to GUI
* clear function, to clear GUI

### notes
Code was a success, use of while loop running iterations of addEventListener(click) applied event to each button
Each button clicked therefore is added to the GUI as part of a string
This string is then turned into an expression with eval and calculated
